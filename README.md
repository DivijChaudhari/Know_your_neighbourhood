# :house_with_garden: Know_your_neighbourhood_a_better_way.

**Problem Statement** - Daily hundreds of people have to shift to some new places due to their jobs, most of them face difficulties as the place is totally new to them. It would be really helpful if they get to know their neighbors and get help from them.

**Technologies included** - Cloud, DevOps, mobile app development (Flutter, React .. we can work on any of them as most of you will choose to work on.)

**Aim** - To build an application for newly shifted people to chat with their neighbours helping them know each other.
We will get the user's location then show them chat rooms available nearby based on their location where they can chat anonymously and if any user wants to connect then they can reveal their identity as and when they want to.
